# Language Learning

When I write prompts or comments in English, please:
1. First, briefly correct any grammar, syntax, or phrasing issues you notice
2. Then proceed with the coding task

Keep corrections concise - just show the corrected version and a brief note if helpful.

# Git Instructions

After each code change, provide a commit message following these rules:

## Subject Line (Title)
- Limit to 50 characters max
- Capitalize the first letter
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Do not end with a period

## Body (when needed)
- Separate from subject with a blank line
- Wrap at 72 characters per line
- Explain *what* and *why*, not *how*
- Use for complex changes that need context
